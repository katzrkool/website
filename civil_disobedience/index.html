        <h1>Corporate Tax Breaks & Civil Disobedience</h1>
        <p>Corporate Tax Breaks and Cuts allow large corporations bringing in millions or billions of dollars in profits to pay much less than (or nothing of) their fair share in taxes.</p>
        <p>For example: Amazon profited over <strong>$11 billion</strong> in 2018, but due to cuts and breaks, will be paying <strong>zero</strong> dollars in taxes <sup><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-taxes-zero-180337770.html">1</a></sup>.</p>

        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>Over the years, corporations have discovered new loopholes to avoid paying taxes, like storing money in a different country. Over the past twenty years, the amount of money we lose to corporate tax breaks has reached 134%<sup><a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/campaigns/corp-taxes-and-federal-budget/">2</a></sup></p>
        <br>
        <p>Two years ago, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed, which included several more ways for big companies to pay less taxes. First and foremost, the corporate tax rate dropped from 35% to 21%.</p>
        <p>Before the TCJA, there was the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) set at 20%, to ensure large companies paid taxes still. Basically, a company would compute their normal taxes (including breaks and benefits), and a flat 20% of their profit <sup><a href="https://www.finweb.com/taxes/what-is-the-corporate-alternative-minimum-tax.html">3</a></sup>. They would then pay whichever was higher, which prevented benefits and breaks from stacking to high, and companies paying no taxes.</p>
        <p>The TCJA has repealed the AMT, making it possible for corporations to pay zero in taxes, as we've seen with Amazon <sup><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/25/a-fixable-mistake-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/">4</a></sup>.</p>
        
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center">It's simple: Money</h4>
        <p>Corporations and their money influenced our government, and pressured the controlling party at the time to pass it.
        <p>Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said the GOP donors would stop sponsoring them, and that financial contributions would stop, if tax reform like the TCJA wasn't passed.<sup><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/359606-graham-financial-contributions-will-stop-if-gop-doesnt-pass-tax-reform">5</a></sup></p>
        
        <h2>Civil Disobedience</h2>
        <p>Without corporation-level money, it can be hard to change the laws ourselves. A similar movement is the <strong>Occupy Movement</strong> which used protests and demonstrations to try to get their points across.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement">6</a></sup></p>
        <p>A few years ago, another protest occurred, where some refused to pay taxes, in protest to the Trump administration <sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/tax-refusing-pay-protest-trump">7</a></sup>. A similiar method of civil disobedience regarding not paying taxes may be apt to this situation. However, the potential punishment from not paying taxes can be much steeper than other civil disobedience methods.</p>
