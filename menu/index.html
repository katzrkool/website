        <h1>The New School Menu is on hiatus</h1>
        <p>Recently, I noticed The New School switch dining providers from FLIK Dining to 
            <a href="https://www.sagedining.com/">SAGE Dining</a>. Since my menu pulls data from FLIK, it isn't accurate anymore.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So, over the next few weeks, I'm going to try to add support for the SAGE Dining menus, and also clean up the existing codebase in the process. 
            Based on the initial research I've done, getting SAGE data is going to be harder than FLIK data.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>FLIK data is relatively easily to get, as they have a public website listing menu data. SAGE on the other hand, requires one to download a mobile app, sign up for an account with an email address, and only then can one see the menu. (Seems completely unneccessary and annoying)</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am going to try my best to find a way to get this data, and relay it onto this site so you can check the menu without logging into a (not very good) mobile app. I'll make sure to update this page as the project progresses.</p>
