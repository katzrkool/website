		<h1>The New School Menu is on hiatus</h1>
		<p>As you most likely know, The New School has changed their dining provider from FLIK Dining to Sage Dining. I am currently working on updating my menu to support the change and hope to be finished in the next week or two.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Until then, the Sage Dining has <a href="https://www.sagedining.com/menus/thenewschool">their own online menu</a> you can use.
