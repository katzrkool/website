		<h1>The New School Menu is on hiatus</h1>
		<p>As many of you are aware, there is no more school for the rest of the year. This means there is no more lunch being served at The New School, because no one is there to eat it. If there is no lunch, there is no menu data, and so I have nothing to display</p>

		<p>Anyways, I've put the menu on pause for the rest of the school year and summer. If TNS returns to physical school this fall, the menu shall return.</p>
