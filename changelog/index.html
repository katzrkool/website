<h2>Made Grades Better - 2019-1-22</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a teacher put in one assignment, worth zero points, grades would crash because it would try to get the average, but it would divide by zero and crash. That was fixed</li>
<li>If it breaks, myBackpack breaks, or you break it, you'll be better informed on what happened</li>
</ul>

		<h2>Menu & Grades updates - 2018-12-10</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Menu now uses an sqlite3 database instead of a JSON file. Performance is up</li>
			<li>As a side effect of the database change, the menu now won't delete old data, historical data will be available from December 2018. Possibly extending later</li>
			<li>Grade Checker now has a nifty analytic that reads something like "You've earned 154.0 points out of 175.0 points. 154.0 / 175.0 = 0.88" for every subject. It should help anyone wanting to do manual calculations.</li>
			<li>The Grade Checker api endpoint is now at /api</li>
			<li>Menu now says how many times chicken has been served on days that serve chicken.</li>
