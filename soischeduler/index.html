	<h1>SOI Scheduler</h1>
	<p>A Siri Shortcut to schedule events happening at the Don Tyson School of Innovation.<br><br>
	Intended to be used to schedule events during class periods: e.g. History Exam during 4B.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>You'll need to install two shortcuts (a classic two for one)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02e91b6d525043029b2139f68aacaa63">Get Upcoming Weekdays</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3d57af02fe214b19bdc76d1e007e5d9a">SOI Scheduler</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The Get Upcoming Weekdays Shortcut acts as a helper tool to the SOI Scheduler, and the scheduler won't work without it. It's best to install Get Upcoming Weekdays first.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	After installing the SOI Scheduler, you'll be presented with 9 screens: the first 8 ask what classes you have (1A, 2A, etc), and the last screen asks what calendar to put your events on.
	</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Upon running the shortcut, it'll ask you what date the event takes place on. If the date you want isn't on the list, tap Custom for more.
			</td>
			<td>
				<img class="screenshot" src="screenshots/datePicker.png">
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>After picking a date, it'll ask you what class the event falls on (or primetime if it's Wednesday).
			</td>
			<td>
				<img class="screenshot" src="screenshots/classPicker.jpg">
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>It'll then ask what the event is called. An example could be "Unit 5 Exam".
			</td>
			<td>
				<img class="screenshot" src="screenshots/nameAsker.png">
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>If the class selected is not a primetime, it'll ask if you want to prefix the class name to the event title. Just click whichever one you want.
			</td>
			<td>
				<img class="screenshot" src="screenshots/namePicker.jpg">
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			After that, the shortcut will be done, and you can find your event in your calendar app of choice!
			</td>
			<td>
